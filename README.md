We aim to design and implement TARIFF, a system dedicated to simplifying the process of
determining import tariffs and additional foreign fees. The platform’s core function will be to
calculate tariff costs for specific industries or products between different countries at any
given time.
At its heart, TARIFF will serve as a unified tariff calculation engine. Instead of forcing
businesses and consumers to navigate fragmented databases and legal documents, it will
centralize all relevant data—base tariff rates, product classifications, trade agreements, and
quota thresholds—into one system. Through a REST API–powered backend and a
user-friendly interface, users will be able to obtain real-time, accurate tariff calculations with
minimal friction.
